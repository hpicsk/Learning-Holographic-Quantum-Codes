This file can still be loaded, to do so you have two options, \u001b[1mdo those steps only if you trust the source of the checkpoint\u001b[0m. \n\t(1) In PyTorch 2.6, we changed the default value of the `weights_only` argument in `torch.load` from `False` to `True`. Re-running `torch.load` with `weights_only` set to `False` will likely succeed, but it can result in arbitrary code execution. Do it only if you got the file from a trusted source.\n\t(2) Alternatively, to load with `weights_only=True` please check the recommended steps in the following error message.\n\tWeightsUnpickler error: Unsupported global: GLOBAL numpy.core.multiarray.scalar was not an allowed global by default.
